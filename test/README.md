These tests are taken from github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests

The attached license applies to the test code in this directory
only. The license in the project root covers risclet itself.

Use the `Makefile` to build `a.out`, then run it using:

    risclet -l false -m run

I include a pre-built `a.out` for convenience.
